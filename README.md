# AWS-IAM-Policy-Review-and-Cleanup
Python script that analyzes AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. It could identify overly permissive policies, unused or stale IAM users and roles, and offer options to clean up or refine the IAM configurations to reduce security risks.




This repository contains a set of Python scripts for managing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. These scripts help analyze, clean up, and maintain IAM policies to enhance security and compliance.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- AWS CLI configured with the necessary permissions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iam-policy-management.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd iam-policy-management

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

bash

python3 -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

bash

source venv/bin/activate

Install the required Python packages:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
IAM Policy Analysis

To perform IAM policy analysis, run the following command:

bash

python iam_policy_analysis.py

This script will analyze your IAM policies for potential security risks.
Unused Resources Detection

To detect and list unused IAM roles and users, run the following command:

bash

python unused_resources_detection.py

Policy Simulation

To simulate the effect of IAM policies on specific AWS resources, run the following command:

bash

python policy_simulation.py

Policy Documentation

To generate and export documentation for IAM policies, run the following command:

bash

python policy_documentation.py

Risk Scoring

To calculate a risk score for a specific IAM policy, run the following command:

bash

python risk_scoring.py

Automated Cleanup Actions

To remove unused IAM roles or modify policy permissions to be more restrictive, run the following command:

bash

python automated_cleanup.py

Alerting and Notification

To send alerts for high-risk policies or other events, run the following command:

bash

python alerting_and_notification.py

Logging and Auditing

To implement logging and auditing of policy changes and cleanup activities, run the following command:

bash

python logging_and_auditing.py

Compliance Checks

To check for compliance with AWS best practices and security standards, run the following command:

bash

python compliance_checks.py

Schedule-Based Analysis

For schedule-based analysis, you can set up a cron job or a scheduled task to run the desired scripts at regular intervals. Make sure to configure the schedule based on your requirements.
Integration with AWS Organizations

For AWS Organizations integration, customize the integrate_with_aws_organizations function in aws_organizations_integration.py to manage policies across multiple AWS accounts.
Role Permission Analysis

For role permission analysis, provide the desired role details in role_permission_analysis.py and run the script to analyze permissions attached to the IAM role.
Custom Policy Checks

For custom policy checks, customize the custom_policy_checks function in custom_policy_checks.py to implement checks specific to your organization's security requirements.
